# 💫 About Me:
💻 Currently working on: Being an extremely average developer who sometimes writes good code… by accident.<br><br>🤝 Looking to collaborate on: Anything that doesn’t involve excessive math or debugging at 3 AM.<br><br>🛠  Need help with: JavaScript. Because no matter how long I stare at it, I still don’t fully understand why null is an object.<br><br>🌱 Currently learning: How to Google errors more efficiently so I look like I know what I’m doing. Also, CSS. because one misplaced div can ruin my entire day.<br><br>💬 Ask me about: My elite ability to break my own code in ways no one thought possible. Also, why every tutorial makes things look way easier than they actually are.<br><br>⚡ Fun fact: I once spent 2 hours debugging a problem that could’ve been fixed by refreshing the page. I’m still recovering.
